## Step 4: Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. **Set Up GitHub Actions**:
   Add the following configuration in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

   ```yaml
   name: ci 
   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - master 
         - main
   permissions:
     contents: write
   jobs:
     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
         - name: Configure Git Credentials
           run: |
             git config user.name github-actions[bot]
             git config user.email 41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com
         - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
           with:
             python-version: 3.x
         - run: echo "cache_id=$(date --utc '+%V')" >> $GITHUB_ENV 
         - uses: actions/cache@v4
           with:
             key: mkdocs-material-${{ env.cache_id }}
             path: .cache
             restore-keys: |
               mkdocs-material-
         - run: pip install mkdocs-material mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin mkdocs-minify-plugin
         - run: mkdocs gh-deploy --force
   ```

2. **Push Your Changes**:
   Commit and push your project to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial documentation setup"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Access Your Site**:
   After GitHub Actions finish deploying, your site will be live at:
   ```
   https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/
   ```
